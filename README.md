When I was first introduced to creative computing I felt extremely overwhelmed and had never done anything like this before. I was struggling, I was frustrated with myself and felt I was incapable of even doing something like this. <br>
Therefore, I have written this to help others who may feel the same as I did. <br>

Arduino<br>
TinkerCAD<br>
These are both physical computing platforms that provide step by step tutorials for the Arduino Uno. <br>
When first experimenting with different circuits, I was struggling alot with following the steps and using each separate components. Therefore, I watched a youtube video on
