# <strong>A Beginner's Guide to Creative Computing</strong>

<pr> *A guide created for GCD students who are struggling to grasp and are confused about creative computing.*
  </p>
When I was first introduced to creative computing I felt extremely overwhelmed and had never done anything like this before. I was struggling, I was frustrated with myself and felt I was incapable of even doing something like this. <br>
Therefore, I have written this to help others who may feel the same as I did. <br>
<br>
<strong>DEFINITIONS</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Open-source</strong><br>
Open source software is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner. Open-souce software is a prominent example of open collaboration, meaning any capable user is able to participate online in development, making the number of possible contributors indefinite. The ability to examine the code facilitates public trust in the software.<br>
<br>
<strong>ReadMe</strong><br>
The Readme file is often the first file which the users read. It is a text file that contains the information for the user about the software, project, code, game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates.<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>What is</em> <strong>Physical Computing?</strong><br>
Physical computing means interacting with real-world objects by programming them from a computer.<br>
Arduino<br>
TinkerCAD<br>
These are both physical computing platforms that provide step by step tutorials for the Arduino Uno. <br>
When first experimenting with different circuits, I was struggling alot with following the steps and using each separate components. Therefore, I watched a youtube video on an Arduino tutorial: LED sequential control<br>
<br>
LED Sequential Control step-by-step<br>
<br>
You will need:<br>
1 x Arduino Uno<br>
1 x Breadboard <br>
1 x USB cable <br>
3 x 220 ohm resistors <br>
4 x jumper wires <br>
3 x different coloured LEDs <br>
<br>
Step 1: Use a jumper wire to connect the ground rail on the Arduino to the negative rail on the Breadboard to find a common ground.<br>
Step 2: Insert the all of the resistors into the breadboard spaced out. With one leg connected to the negative rail and the other in row 'E' of the breadboard.<br>
Step 3: Now insert the LEDs, the longer side is positive, and the shorter side is negative. Connect the negative side of the LED to the horizontal rail where one of your resistors is connected, and connect the positive side to an adjacent rail. Repeat this process for each LED and each resistor.<br>
Step 4: Now to complete the circuit, use 3 jumper wires to connect the outputs 13, 12 and 11 on the Arduino uno to each of the separate LEDs on the breadboard. Connect the positive LED on the right to output 13, thee LED in the centre to 12 and the LED on the left to 11.<br>
Step 5: Power on the Arduino by connecting the USB to your computer.<br>
Step 6: Download the correct operating system Arduino IDE in order for your system to work. Also make sure the correct port is selected.<br>
Step 7: Finally, press the upload button on the top left-hand corner of the screen to upload the programme. You will now see a green progress bar to show you how long the upload should take. If there are any errors, a message should appear in the black box at the bottom of the screen.<br>

Your LEDs should now be working on your Arduino.
